Mad Money,Jim Cramer: Own these stocks if the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged,"Published Mon, Jun 14 20216:37 PM EDT",Tyler Clifford,"Key PointsCNBC's Jim Cramer recommended a handful of industrial and energy stocks for investor to own, should the Federal Reserve keep interest rates unchanged.""These are the kind of companies that thrive when economies around the world are growing, and that's exactly what I expect,"" he said.In this articleFBXOMCVXDOWCLFCATVIDEO3:3703:37Jim Cramer recommends stocks ahead of key Federal Reserve meetingMad Money with Jim CramerCNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday that investors should think about buying some industrial and energy names if the Federal Reserve keeps rates unchanged at this week's meeting.""If you think, as I do, that the Fed will keep the fires going, you'll want to own a steel stock or a heavy machinery play or a chemical company,"" Cramer said on ""Mad Money."" ""I even sanction some energy stocks because many of these companies have changed their suboptimal ways.""Cramer recommended investors take a look at stocks like chemical-maker Dow Inc, heavy machinery company Caterpillar and Cleveland-Cliffs, the iron ore and steel products producer whose shares cratered 9% Monday. Dow Inc and Caterpillar also fell slightly on Monday. He also pointed to energy stocks Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Pioneer Natural Resources as potential buys for investors.""These are the kind of companies that thrive when economies around the world are growing, and that's exactly what I expect,"" Cramer said.The Fed is slated to start its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The central bank is not expected to move interest rates. However, investors will be looking for clues on whether the Fed has changed its stance on U.S. inflation. The meeting is set to wrap up on Wednesday.Cramer's comments came after gains in growth and technology names carried the Nasdaq Composite to a fresh record close. The S&P 500 staged a late-day rally to also close at an all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, closing slightly lower.The moves Monday in growth stocks — such as social media giant Facebook, cloud messaging platform Twilio, cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike and the e-commerce site Etsy — represented a belief the economy could be cooling down or the Fed could hike interest rates to keep the economy from overheating, Cramer said.CrowdStrike shares rose about 1%, while Facebook advanced 1.7%. Etsy moved 2.7% higher, and Twilio climbed 3%.""Until we see … the whites of the [Fed's] eyes on Wednesday, you can expect the action to look like today, where we had lots of traffic in the junior and senior growth aisles, with shoppers fleeing from the messy industrial aisles and bank stock aisles,"" he said.VIDEO8:4208:42Jim Cramer's approach to the market ahead of Wednesday's key Fed meetingMad Money with Jim CramerDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Facebook.DisclaimerQuestions for Cramer?

Technology Executive Council,Apps are changing the shopping experience at The Vitamin Shoppe and Tractor Supply Co.,"Published Mon, Jun 14 20211:59 PM EDT",Susan Caminiti,"Key PointsFor brick-and-mortar retailers, mobile apps have been a game-changer.App users are among the most loyal customers. Giving customers the ability to shop anywhere and from any device is not going away after the pandemic is over. In this articleTSCOGetty ImagesAmidst all the noise and debate over whether Apple wields too much power as a platform is this undeniable fact: for brick-and-mortar retailers, mobile apps and the App Store have been a game-changer.The earliest days of the pandemic brought retailers to a standstill. Customers, afraid to shop in-person for fear of the coronavirus, immediately turned to smartphones and laptops to purchase the things they needed and wanted. Curbside pick-up and home delivery of everything from groceries and meals to home improvement and pet food became the order of the day, forcing retailers to revamp e-commerce platforms and launch mobile apps in record time.CNBC Technology Executive Council members Andy Laudato of The Vitamin Shoppe and Tractor Supply Company's Glenn Allison understand this transformation first-hand. They recently spoke at a TEC livestream event on LinkedIn where they explained how digital apps transformed the entire shopping experience for their customers throughout the pandemic, why app users are their most loyal customers, and why those changes are here to stay.With over 1,900 stores in 49 states, Tractor Supply Co. all but defines the rural lifestyle in retailing. Allison, vice president of customer facing applications and data analytics at the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, says the pandemic pushed TSC to launch a wide range of digital capabilities, all designed to meet the newly changing needs of its customers. In addition to upgrading its website by leveraging the cloud through Microsoft's Azure, TSC launched its first mobile app for consumers, he says.Launching the app during the pandemic not only enabled TSC to give customers yet another safe, secure way to shop, Allison says, but it also enabled lots of other changes that added to the customer experience. Curbside pick-up was introduced chain-wide, enabling customers to order from their phone, tablet, or laptop and pick-up goods outside the store. The app also prompted the retailer to upgrade the Wi-Fi inside its stores and enable Wi-Fi access in its massive parking lots so that customers could connect easily and quickly.""Whether customers were buying online or through the app, we wanted this curbside pickup to be just completely customer-focused and easy,"" Allison says.The Vitamin Shoppe is a retailer focused on health and wellness and both were top of mind when it came to employees and customers in the earliest days of the pandemic, says chief operating officer Andy Laudato. He says the company rushed to launch contactless payments like Apple Pay and others, provided digital receipts, and enabled customers to scan products themselves when they came into Vitamin Shoppe stores.In 2014, the company launched an app to manage its loyalty program, Laudao says, but in 2017 expanded it to handle customer transactions. A separate internal app for employees enables salespeople to look up customer data and product details. ""The vitamin and wellness categories are very complex and we needed a way to give our people the ability to understand and check on products so they could answer customer questions and make recommendations,"" he says. There are also nutritionists within its stores and customers in the retailer's loyalty program can schedule video chats and connect without ever having to come into a physical location.Like TSC, The Vitamin Shoppe introduced curbside pick-up at its stores during the pandemic, and last summer partnered with Instacart for same-day delivery of its products. ""There was so much acceleration of digital during the pandemic, but because all of these things make it easier for the customer to do business with us, they're all staying,"" Laudato says. ""We can really offer seamless experiences across every single channel, with the app at the forefront of that.""We can really offer seamless experiences across every single channel, with the app at the forefront of that.Andy Laudato, COO, The Vitamin Shoppe And while both Laudato and Allen recognize the margin implications of doing business in the App Store, they say they will follow customer preferences. ""Generally our customers tend to download our app from the Apple ecosystem,"" says Laudato. Allen says Apple has been ""a great source of feedback and a direct link to our customers and what they're looking for.""""We have to make it easy for our customers to shop with us from anywhere and in any way they choose,"" he adds. The pandemic might have forced that digital transformation to happen quickly for retailers, but it's unlikely customers are ever going to want to shop any other way."

Wall Street set to open steady after another S&P 500 recordTraders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.Source: NYSEU.S. stock futures were flat Monday after the S&P 500 eked out another record close Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% for the week, notching a three-week winning streak. The Nasdaq's gain Friday put the tech-heavy index within 0.5% of its record close in late April. The Nasdaq soared nearly 1.9% for the week, logging its fourth straight weekly gain. The Dow's slight advance Friday inched the 30-stock average less than 1% closer to last month's record close. However, the Dow dropped 0.8%, breaking a two-week winning streak.The 10-year Treasury yield was steady early Monday, firmly below 1.5%, ahead of Federal Reserve's June meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. Inflation will be front and center on investors' minds after last week's hotter-than-expected consumer price index reading for May. The Fed has been promising to keep its extraordinary Covid-era easy money measures in place — massive asset buying and near zero interest rates — claiming any price pressures will be transitory.2.

Tech to Table,Beyond the punch card: Restaurants lean into loyalty programs to hold onto pandemic digital gains,"Published Fri, Jun 11 202110:49 AM EDT",Amelia Lucas,"Key PointsMcDonald's and Jack in the Box are among the restaurant chains with plans to launch loyalty programs this year to retain the digital customers they gained during the pandemic.Restaurant digital orders surged 124% in the year ended in March, according to the NPD Group.Consumer data from loyalty programs helps restaurants personalize the experience and target customers with tailored offers and discounts.In this articleJACKWENCMGDPZSBUXMCDQSR-CAYUMAn employee carries an order for a customer at a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Detroit.Sean Proctor | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesForget the battle for chicken sandwich supremacy. The loyalty program wars are coming.Restaurant digital orders surged 124% in the year ended in March, according to market researcher NPD Group. And the skyrocketing popularity of online ordering during the coronavirus pandemic is motivating big fast-food chains to use rewards programs to hold onto new mobile app customers. By now, most restaurant chains automatically sign customers up for loyalty programs once diners order via a mobile app.Starbucks, Panera Bread and Domino's Pizza paved the way, while Chipotle Mexican Grill launched its own version in 2019. But the last year has brought even more players into the arena. Wendy's, Yum Brands' Taco Bell and Restaurant Brands International's Burger King are among the new entrants, and McDonald's and Jack in the Box are gearing up to launch loyalty programs later this year.""With Covid-19 and consumers' shift in behavior, we've really seen a giant uptick in it, from the biggest brands that were kind of holding out, I'd say, are now launching programs to keep consumers returning and keep that loyalty,"" said Elle Kross, director of client strategy for travel, hospitality and food services at digital marketing firm Movable Ink.Loyalty programs help fuel more frequent visits and higher average checks, according to Aaron Allen, founder of restaurant consulting firm Aaron Allen & Associates.For example, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told analysts in April that the company's loyalty program has been driving additional transactions across its ""light, medium and heavy consumer segments."" Before the pandemic, the chain's program had 8.5 million members. Now, it has more than 21 million members.Digital orders made up the majority of the company's quarterly sales for first time ever during the first three months of this year. Chipotle has kept pushing consumers toward its loyalty program by giving them early releases on new menu items and keeping some items, like the quesadilla, available only by digital order.However, those aren't the only factors driving the loyalty program boom among restaurants. Companies are also eager to learn more about customers — collecting and analyzing data based on their ordering preferences and personal information. This consumer data can be used to target customers better, both with marketing offers and for future opportunities, like new menu items.""We've come a long way from the Subway punch card,"" Allen said.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwardsFor now, customers largely don't mind giving away this data about themselves in exchange for the occasional free drink or discount. Goldman Sachs surveyed 2,000 consumers about their opinions on tech features within the restaurant industry. Loyalty programs are rising in importance to these consumers, the survey found.While restaurant loyalty programs differ in design and rewards, most programs don't use separate tiers based on how many points members have racked up, unlike airline rewards programs. For example, Starbucks dropped its tiers in 2019 in a bid to get new members more engaged with its loyalty program.  In the three quarters following Starbucks making that change, it added 3.1 million loyalty members, up 15% from the same time in 2019. And throughout that period, it reported strong quarterly U.S. same-store sales growth, excluding when the pandemic began to take a toll on the business.During the crisis, the coffee giant made another major change to its loyalty program, expanding the number of payment options to include cash and PayPal. In Starbucks' fiscal second quarter of this year, 52% of sales at U.S. company-owned cafes came from Starbucks Rewards members. Mobile orders accounted for 26% of U.S. company-owned transactions, up from 18% a year earlier.That's the kind of digital growth and loyalty that McDonald's is hoping to emulate with its upcoming rewards program. The chain's U.S. president, Joe Erlinger, told analysts in April that the company saw digital sales of almost $1.5 billion during its first quarter, including orders on its digital kiosks, mobile app and delivery platforms. But that number could be even higher. As of February, it's testing the program in 900 of its 14,000 U.S. locations, with restaurants in Arizona, Nevada and New England taking part.Restaurants are also leaning on loyalty programs to help lend a more personal touch to interactions with customers, even as they zoom in and out of the drive-thru lane. Panera Bread's newest restaurant design will automatically recognize loyalty members, whether they go through the drive-thru or enter the location.""Once you are identified, the vision is that we interact and acknowledge and treat you as a person, with preferences,"" Panera Chief Brand and Concept Officer Eduardo Luz said in a May interview. ""It's what you expect when you go to a neighborhood cafe.""Luz said the company is considering several options to make this a reality, including scanning a code or microfencing technology. The first location with the new restaurant design is slated to open in November in Ballwin, Missouri.One of the big questions for restaurants with existing loyalty programs is how to retain loyalty members even as competitors launch rival plans. Fast-food chains may have to ramp up the number or quality of rewards for members, betting that the boon of consumer data makes up for those losses.""The breaking point or tipping point is that we don't want to download an app for every place that we visit,"" Allen said. ""So we think that's another driver that's dividing the haves and have nots.""Large restaurant chains like McDonald's and Chipotle have the capital to invest in technology, like improving mobile apps and building frictionless rewards programs. But smaller chains and independent eateries won't be able to keep up in the same way. Instead, third-party companies could build loyalty programs for smaller players, but the companies using these plans won't receive the same customer data as a chain that built its own rewards program.Competition is likely even among the big chains. Allen predicts that the restaurant giants will become more savvy and aggressive, employing strategies similar to those in the hospitality industry. Hilton Honors, for example, matches the rewards status for customers of rival hoteliers.Kross pointed to Dunkin's year-in-review emails for loyalty members, similar to those created by Peloton and Spotify, as one example of a fast-food chain that's already getting creative.

Sustainable Energy,Cement giant LafargeHolcim is teaming up with GE's renewables unit on wind turbine recycling ,"Published Fri, Jun 11 20217:18 AM EDT",Anmar Frangoul,"Key PointsBusiness practices connected to the notion of a circular economy have gained traction in recent years.The issue of what to do with wind turbine blades when they're no longer needed is a headache for the industry. In this articleVWS-DKORSTED-DKGEDaniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGeneral Electric's renewables unit and LafargeHolcim, the world's biggest cement manufacturer, have struck a deal to explore the recycling of wind turbine blades.A memorandum of understanding will see the companies focus on exploring ""circular economy solutions."" Business practices connected to the notion of a circular economy have gained traction in recent years, with many companies around the world looking to operate in a way which minimizes waste. In a statement Thursday, the firms added they were looking into ""new ways of recycling wind blades, including as a construction material to build new wind farms.""The plans announced this week build on an already existing relationship between the two companies. Last June, GE Renewable Energy said it was going to partner with LafargeHolcim and another firm, COBOD International, to develop wind turbines that use 3D-printed concrete bases. The issue of what to do with wind turbine blades when they're no longer needed is a headache for the industry. This is because the composite materials used in their production can be difficult to recycle, with many blades ending up as landfill when their service life ends.As governments around the world attempt to ramp up their renewable energy capacity, the number of wind turbines on the planet only looks set to grow. This will in turn increase pressure on the sector to find sustainable solutions to the disposal of blades. Over the last few years, major players in wind energy have announced plans to try to tackle the problem. Just last week Denmark's Orsted said it would ""reuse, recycle, or recover"" all turbine blades in its worldwide portfolio of wind farms once they're decommissioned. In April, it was announced that a collaboration between academia and industry would focus on the recycling of glass fiber products, a move that could eventually help to reduce the waste produced by wind turbine blades.Last December, GE Renewable Energy and Veolia North America signed a ""multi-year agreement"" to recycle blades removed from onshore wind turbines in the United States. And in January 2020, wind energy giant Vestas said it was aiming to produce ""zero-waste"" turbines by the year 2040."
Invest in You: Ready. Set. Grow.,"As travel demand surges and prices rise, here are 7 ways to save money this summer","Published Fri, Jun 11 20218:00 AM EDT",Michelle Fox,"Erik Isakson | Tetra images | Getty ImagesAmericans want their summer vacations.After a year of restricted movement during the pandemic, 80% in a recent survey by tourism market research firm Destination Analysts said they are ready to travel.However, with that demand comes higher prices. Airline tickets are up 7% for the month and 24% from the year prior, according to the consumer price index for May, the Labor Department reported Thursday.Car and truck rental rates jumped 12.1% in May, rising 110% from a year ago, and gas is up 56.2% over the past year.More from Invest in You:Almost half of Americans will take on debt to treat themselves post-pandemicHow to resist the urge to splurge in a post-pandemic spending spreeHow to avoid overspending in this hot housing marketYet there still are ways to spend smartly.""Whether it is international or domestic, it is best to plan out every stage of your trip in advance to make sure there are not any hidden sticker shocks,"" said Jordan Staab, president of SmarterTravel Media.Here's how you can save money when planning your next vacation.1. Road trip itThe best way to save money is to drive your own car to your destination, Staab said.To find the cheapest fuel prices during your road trip, he suggests downloading the GasBuddy app.2. Don't wait until the last minuteStaab anticipates the cost of flying will continue to rise until the Fourth of July, so if you want to book a summer trip, get on it right away, he advised.If you have more flexibility and are comfortable waiting, there's a chance prices could start going down after Independence Day.VIDEO2:4702:47Travel picks up across the U.S. as vaccination rates riseThe News with Shepard SmithBut if you book the flight too close to the actual trip date, you could wind up paying more. The best time to buy your airline tickets is in what Scott Keyes, founder of travel deal websites and newsletter Scott's Cheap Flights, calls the ""Goldilocks window"" — not too early and not too late.For domestic trips, the cheap flights are most likely to pop up one to three months in advance of your travel date. If you are traveling internationally, they are mostly likely to occur two to eight months in advance, he said. You can monitor fares by setting up price alerts.3. Be flexibleTypically people choose a destination, when the trip will occur and then look up airfares.Instead, flip that on its head, Keyes said. Look up cheap flights out of your home airport and choose the destination that most interests you. Then, see what dates work with your schedule.""By setting price as the top priority rather than the last priority, that's how you get cheap flights,"" Keyes said.The Great Arch in Zion National Park, Utah.DANIEL SLIM | AFP | Getty ImagesYou may also find cheaper airfare at another nearby airport. It may mean a farther drive, but it doesn't necessarily result in a longer travel time. For instance, that longer drive may result in a flight that doesn't have as many stops along the way.If you are traveling to a far-flung destination, you can also find less expensive airfares to a major city and then take a local budget airline, ferry or train to your final destination.4. Remember the daysIt's no longer true that there is a best day of the week to book a flight, since new prices are constantly coming online, Keyes said.However, there tend to be cheaper days to actually fly: Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday.5. Think outside the boxBeaches and national parks are extremely popular in the summer. In fact, if you want to visit a national park, Staab advises making a reservation first. In many parks, reservations are mandatory.To save money, consider a place that is not your normal destination, like the mountains instead of the beach.""If it is something everyone wants to do, it is going to be expensive,"" Staab said.6. Don't forget about Covid testingAn airport hostess waits to assist passengers going through a rapid Covid-19 testing area at Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy, on April 2, 2021.PIERO CRUCIATTI | AFP | Getty ImagesYou may need a coronavirus test before traveling, so research your destination to make sure you know what is required.Some drugstore chains offer PCR testing at no additional cost if you use insurance, or if you fall under a federal program. You can also get rapid and PCR tests at some airports for a fee.While you often have to pay for the test ahead of travel, many hotels and destinations are offering free testing, Staab noted. Some destinations will even pay you for a negative Covid test. For instance, Portugal's Azores Islands offer a 35 euro voucher to offset the cost of the mandatory Covid test, he pointed out.7. Hold off until fallIf you don't have school-aged children, or don't mind them missing a few days of class, then consider waiting to travel until the summer is over.""If you travel during off-peak times, then you can find some great deals,"" said Staab, who noted one of his favorite time to travel is in September.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.CHECK OUT: 4 content-creating side hustles that can produce passive income, with tips from the pros via Grow with Acorns+CNBCDisclosure: NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are investors in Acorns."

One method includes using electrolysis, with an electric current splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen.If the electricity used in the process comes from a renewable source, such as wind or solar, then some call it ""green"" or ""renewable"" hydrogen.Currently, however, the vast majority of hydrogen generation is based on fossil fuels, and green hydrogen is expensive to produce.In recent times, a number of major industrial firms have announced plans to integrate green hydrogen into their operations.In addition, major economies such as the European Union have laid out plans to install at least 40 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030.Efforts are also being made to drive costs down. On Monday the U.S. Department of Energy launched its Energy Earthshots Initiative and said the first of these would focus on cutting the cost of ""clean"" hydrogen to $1 per kilogram (2.2 lbs) in a decade.According to the DOE, hydrogen from renewables is priced at around $5 a kilogram today. ""Clean hydrogen is a game-changer,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said Monday, adding that it would help to ""decarbonize high-polluting heavy-duty and industrial sectors.""On Wednesday Ben Gallagher, who is lead analyst for emerging technologies at research group Wood Mackenzie, sought to highlight how the environment surrounding green hydrogen appeared to be changing.""An increasingly dynamic low-carbon hydrogen market has seen a deluge of government support, corporate commitments, announced projects and even bystander intrigue over the past 18 months,"" he said.""We believe this activity amounts to a paradigm shift which will see green hydrogen — hydrogen created from the electrolysis of water using renewable energy — emerge as a key element of the energy transition,"" he added."

College Voices,College interrupted: Many students chose to take time off instead of remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic,"Published Wed, Jun 9 202112:04 PM EDT",Christian Rodriguez,"VIDEO7:1807:18From gap semesters to a gap year: college students during the pandemicCollege VoicesThe Covid-19 pandemic was incredibly challenging for college students and when schools shut down and went to remote classes, many students chose to take time off — a gap year or even a gap semester — instead.Postsecondary enrollments dropped 2.5% in the fall of 2020, nearly twice the rate of decline from a year earlier, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center's December 2020 report. The NSCRC said the primary driver of that decline was a 3.6% drop in undergraduate enrollment.Many students could no longer afford to enroll. Others didn't want a diminished college experience as coronavirus forced most universities online and internships, jobs and study abroad opportunities were canceled. Others were simply burned out from the stress of the pandemic.""My family was in a credit crisis … so there were a lot of questions about our livelihood, what's going to happen to my grandparents [in China]. So there's a lot of stress in the air,"" said Lily Liu, an international student from China in the Stanford University Class of 2022 (formerly '21). ""As the only child in an immigrant family, I think it was really important for me to be able to dedicate my full attention to my family,"" Liu said.Lily Liu, an international student from China attending Stanford University, was supposed to be studying abroad in Paris when the pandemic hit. Instead, she took a year off and moved back home.Source: Lily LiuNicolas Montoya, a student in the Harvard College Class of 2024 (formerly '23), said he found it hard to adjust when campus was closed and students were sent home.""I chose to take a gap year mainly because I didn't have the best experience with the spring semester of 2020, when we decided to go virtual. Being [a] first-gen [college student], it was really hard to find work-life balance and find a place to study at home,"" said Montoya.Marco Balestri, an American History major at Columbia University, had been studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was there for less than three weeks when the pandemic hit and all students were sent home.""I had not started the semester there and decided to withdraw from school for the semester just because I really could not think of the prospect of doing five months of online school,"" Balestri said.More from College Voices:Latinx college students faced family, financial challenges during the pandemicTikTok, Bumble, others are hiring college students as brand ambassadorsI want to move to New York after college graduation. Can I afford it?Gap years are common as some high school students take a year off to travel or volunteer before  college. But that increased dramatically with the pandemic as many incoming freshmen, when faced with the prospect of starting their college life online, opted to take time off instead. Freshman enrollment in college fell 13.1% in the fall of 2020, compared with a drop of just 1.4% in the fall of 2019, according to the NSCRC. Some colleges, like Princeton, Harvard, and Tufts University actually encouraged incoming freshman to consider deferring those admission offers and take a gap year before beginning college. Around 340 Harvard students, or 20% of the incoming freshman class, opted to defer enrollment in fall 2020 – that's more than double the 90 to 130 students they have defer in a typical year.Other campuses saw similar jumps in both incoming and current students taking time off.  But gap years during the pandemic were not the same: With borders closed and lockdown orders imposed because of the global spread of Covid-19, gap year students had to find new ways to gain experience and make an impact during 2020.""I spent my entire year at home. It was kind of a no-brainer because most of the activities I engaged with were unpaid,"" said Liu, who just returned to Stanford recently. Liu was initially supposed to study abroad to Paris, but instead, spent her year at home working on her senior thesis, completing a remote internship, writing music, and working on two different research projects with post-doctoral scholars — one of which investigated the use of technology by local police and was published during the height of the George Floyd movement last summer.Montoya worked full-time as a Covid-19 case investigator and volunteered with an education nonprofit focused on increasing the graduation rate for Hispanic high school students.""Both of my opportunities are completely remote, so I just do them from my childhood bedroom,"" he explained.Nicolas Montoya, a Gates Scholar at Harvard University majoring in social studies in global health and health policy, took a gap year for family reasons as well as to gain real-world experience.Source: Steven Garcia-MachucaBalestri landed two back-to-back field organizer jobs for Democratic Senate campaigns in Maine and Georgia during the 2020 election.""Going into the summer, I realized that I was very much interested in taking that fall semester off. I hadn't committed fully, but I had known I would only do it if I got a full-time position on a campaign,"" Balestri said. ""And for me, I had always known campaigns are one of the best ways for young people, especially college students, to break into politics and government and get a lot of hands-on experience in leadership that you can't get from internships with major corporations, Congress, or your state legislature.""For some students, taking a gap year or semester gave them time to think about what they really wanted to do with their futures.""When I was enrolled, I was just kind of going through the motions of like, 'I should be taking this class to be on track or I should be doing that,'"" Montoya said.  I was actually pre-med when I was enrolled, and now I don't think I'm pre-med anymore. And this is actually something I've determined doing this gap year, working in health care, and just seeing what it really takes to be a doctor and maybe that isn't for me.""It also gave students chances to network and explore fields they're interest in.When I'm moving 200 mph, it's impossible for me to take a step back and think about things,"" said Liu. ""This year, because of the free time, I was able to talk to professionals and people whose work I really admire and from there I decided I want to do a master's [degree] in sustainability. That was not my intention at all before.""Balestri said his high-stakes and hands-on work in politics actually had an impact on his studies.""It's really made me want to dive deeper into the studies I'm working on,"" Balestri said. ""I'm currently writing a thesis on the origins of the voter-registration system in New York State in the early 1900s — so much of that was influenced by my experience working with voter registration on these campaigns.""Marco Balestri, a history major at Columbia University, was studying abroad in Buenos Aires when the pandemic hit. After being sent home, he withdrew from the spring 2020 semester and worked on congressional campaigns.Source: Marco BalestriThe coronavirus pandemic hit Black and Hispanic families harder and that was reflected on college campuses: The number of Black and Hispanic students taking leaves of absence during the spring semester, when the pandemic first hit, increased by 206% and 287%, respectively, compared to a 70% increase for white students and 59% for Asian students, according to a report from the NSCRC.For some students who decide to take time off because of financial or other hardships, there is a very real concern they may not return to college.""Research has shown, for Latinx students in particular, the longer they take gap years, the less likely it is that they are going to return back to campus. So that is something to be very cognizant of, that institutions should be aware of how to support students if they do choose to take a gap year— whether it is by force or voluntarily,"" said Edgar Lopez, a PhD candidate in Urban Education Policy at the University of Southern California.Those interruptions and delays have Lopez and other higher education experts worried that the pandemic will delay college graduation for students of color and exacerbate existing inequalities in higher education.If a student doesn't complete their college degree, it can have a serious ripple effect on the rest of their life — it will be tougher to get a job and they will make less money. The median weekly earnings for someone with some college but no degree is $415 less than that of someone with a bachelor's degree, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That money compounds when you consider earning, saving and investing.So, whether a student chooses to take time off or is forced to for financial or other reasons, experts say it's crucial that they do so with a serious intent to return to campus the next semester or next year.CNBC's ""College Voices"" is a series written by CNBC interns from universities across the country about getting their college education, managing their own money and launching their careers during these extraordinary times.

Stick with paying it off, without adding new purchases to the card.Another option is hybrid programs, like Citi Flex and American Express Plan It, that allow cardholders to pay off certain purchases in installments. You get a specific timeline and usually lower interest rates.""That can be something that lowers your interest bill and psychologically avoids that minimum payment trap that can drag on,"" Rossman said.A fresh startBefore you start getting back into old habits, consider how your financial situation may have improved during the pandemic if you were fortunate enough to keep your job.Over the past year, Americans have actually lowered their debt and saved more money.More from Invest in You:How to resist the urge to splurge in a post-pandemic spending spreeHow to avoid overspending in this hot housing marketHow to vet budgeting and investing appsTotal credit card balances fell  to $770 billion in the first quarter of 2021 from $927 billion at the end of 2019 — a 17% drop, according to the New York Federal Reserve.

Additionally, Ellis said Terran 1's backlog of customer orders makes it ""the most pre-sold rocket in history before launch.""VIDEO4:3704:37Relativity Space CEO on disrupting space industry via 3D-printed rocketsCNBC Disruptor 50The raise, which Ellis described as ""war chest doubled,"" was led by Fidelity and comes eight months after Relativity brought in $500 million in a round led by Tiger Global. The $650 million in equity added BlackRock, Centricus, Coatue and Soroban Capital as new Relativity investors, with a host of existing investors – including Fidelity, Tiger, Baillie Gifford, K5 Global, Tribe Capital, XN, Brad Buss, Mark Cuban, Jared Leto and Spencer Rascoff – building on prior stakes.Relativity has now raised $1.34 billion in capital since its founding in 2015, with its valuation climbing to $4.2 billion from $2.3 billion in November. Its headcount has grown to 400 people, with Ellis saying the company plans to ""add several more hundred this year.""""We've signed up to create a lot of value, certainly remaining the second most highly valued space company in the world,"" Ellis said, as SpaceX commands an industry-leading $74 billion valuation.A timelapse from inside of a 3D-printing bay shows the manufacturing process for a Terran 1 second stage flight tank:Relativity SpaceRelativity is building the first iteration of its Terran 1 rocket and has manufactured 85% of the vehicle for the inaugural launch. It uses multiple 3D-printers, all developed in-house, to build Terran 1 and will do the same for Terran R.The rockets are designed to be almost entirely 3D-printed, an approach which Relativity says makes it less complex, and faster to build or modify, than traditional rockets. Additionally, Relativity says its simpler process will eventually be capable of turning raw material into a rocket on the launchpad in under 60 days.""We're just seeing in the market that there needs to be another quickly-moving, disruptive launch company that's actually skating to where the puck is going,"" Ellis said.He added that Relativity ""never seriously considered the SPAC path,"" believing his company doesn't yet need to go public and can tap ""almost limitless capital"" in the private markets. A SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, is a blank-check company that raises funding from investors to finance a merger with a private company to take it public.Ellis noted that Relativity received higher fundraising offers than the one it accepted from Fidelity, but went with the firm as the lead due to its prestige and reputation.Relativity Space ranked No. 23 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.Taking on SpaceXThe row of two-story tall 3D printer bays at the company's headquarters.Relativity SpaceRelativity's Terran 1 rocket is designed to carry 1,250 kilograms to low Earth orbit. That puts Terran 1 in the middle of the U.S. launch market, in the ""medium-lift"" section between Rocket Lab's Electron and SpaceX's Falcon 9 in capability.But Terran R would go head-to-head with Falcon 9: Targeting a capability of more than 20,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit, almost as tall at 216 feet in length, slightly wider with a 16-foot diameter, and a similarly sized nosecone to carry satellites to space.SpaceX's rocket features nine Merlin engines in the booster, each capable of about 190,000 pounds of thrust, while Relativity's Terran R booster will feature seven Aeon R engines that it says will be capable of 302,000 pounds of thrust each. Earlier this year Relativity completed a full duration test firing of a pathfinder engine, using liquid oxygen and liquid methane as its fuel.Musk's company ships its Falcon 9 boosters via highways from its headquarters in California, and Ellis said Relativity will similarly send its Terran R boosters over land to the coast of Texas, before putting them on a barge to its engine testing facility in Mississippi and then on another barge to Florida.Relativity is aiming to launch the first Terran R mission in 2024 from Cape Canaveral's LC-16 launchpad, where its first Terran 1 missions will also launch. While Relativity is ""nearly out of physical space"" in the headquarters it moved into last summer, Ellis said the company has the core infrastructure in place needed to manufacturing Terran R. It has five large scale 3D-printers and five smaller ""development"" printers, and plans to add two more development bays in the near future. But Ellis noted that the company completed work on a new 3D-printer head, which more than doubles its print speed.""It's not just adding more printer hardware. We're also continuously using the data and learning of printing to actually speed up the process and also make changes to the printer design themselves,"" Ellis said.Ellis emphasized that Terran R has been a part of the plan since Relativity's early days, as the company has seen strong ""market interest and demand for creating this vehicle."" Although he declined to disclose the name of the customer, Relativity has a ""prominent"" initial buyer for Terran R launches.""We've actually been developing [Terran R] this the whole time, so in many ways I feel like this is a weight off my shoulders, a big reveal,"" Ellis said. ""We just needed to get enough traction and resources to be in the spot where now we're going big.""Fully reusing rocketsAn illustration of a Terran 1 rocket, left, next to a Terran R rocket and a silhouette of a person.Relativity SpaceEllis said he is a ""huge fan"" of SpaceX's next-generation Starship rocket, which Musk's company is developing to be fully reusable – hoping to make space travel more akin to air travel.""We need a vehicle that's going to take people to Mars,"" Ellis said. ""[Starship] is huge and I think that capability is necessary.""As Terran R aims to be fully reusable, Ellis described it as ""more a miniature Starship than a Falcon 9 rocket."" While SpaceX reuses the boosters of its Falcon 9 rockets, it has not been able to reuse the upper stages that carry satellites on to orbit. Relativity wants Terran R to be a ""fresh look at what is the best possible"" rocket by designing it to be fully reusable from the beginning.Terran R's booster, or first stage, will use its engines to land standing upright and has features ""that would be nearly impossible to produce without 3D-printing."" Ellis said Relativity's long-term goal is to ""get to hundreds to thousands of reuses"" per rocket. Reusing the second stage will be the next challenge, with Relativity building it ""out of a more exotic 3D-printed metal"" to make it lighter and able to endure the intense temperatures of reentering the Earth's atmosphere.""First stage reuse or even second stage may not work perfectly on the very first try, but every single launch attempt that we're bringing in revenue we're able to continue to develop reusability further,"" Ellis said.A fully reusable rocket would also be able to deliver cargo quickly from one point on the Earth to another, a use the U.S. military has shown great interest in already with SpaceX's Starship.""I think point-to-point space transportation is an interesting market that we're looking at"" with Terran R, Ellis said.More broadly, Ellis remains focused on helping to ""build an industrial base on Mars"" and believes both 3D-printing and fully reusable rockets are key to making that happen.""No one else is doing full reusability and I think that that's a bit depressing – there needs to be more companies actually trying to make the future happen in a big way,"" Ellis said.

The coronavirus had crashed onto Britain's shores weeks earlier, and emergency doctors were initially uncertain how best to treat Tayah's constellation of symptoms, which included stomach pains and a bright red rash.They gave her antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection, but her condition only worsened, her fever spiking. For her parents, for any parents, this was the ultimate medical nightmare; doctors in the dark for days over the cause of their daughter's illness.Eventually, after further blood tests, physicians decided Tayah was suffering from an unusual inflammatory syndrome that pediatric infectious disease specialists had only just started to see, but suspected had links to Sars-COV-2.Young patients across the U.K. and U.S. were arriving in intensive care units with symptoms similar to another disease doctors already recognized, called Kawasaki. But they had no guarantee that the same course of treatment — injecting a solution of donors' antibodies into the bloodstream — would prove successful.In Tayah's case the antibodies solution, known as immunoglobulin, worked, to her parents' relief. But at around that same time last May a team of researchers at Imperial College, London confirmed through complex analyses of blood samples, taken from patients like Tayah, that this was indeed a new disease, distinct from Kawasaki.Hunting inside immune system response to bacteria, virusA related breakthrough in that same laboratory, focused specifically on the way individual genes behave, could have seismic implications for a multi-billion dollar diagnostics sector that has received unprecedented attention from patients, regulators and the business world over the course of this pandemic.A new method for identifying a specific illness from blood samples relies on the correlation between the activity in small set of genes, which represents the immune response, and specific pathogens that cause a specific disease — just as the poliovirus causes polio, the coronavirus (SARS-COV-2, a pathogen) causes Covid-19. Scientists believe that by studying a small number of genes, they can quickly discern which pathogen is in a patient's system, what disease they have, and so how best to treat them. Companies from small research university spin-offs to industry giants like Abbott Laboratories and Danaher's Cepheid are looking to build on two decades of research into the way our own immune systems naturally respond to foreign substances in our bodies, including pathogens like bacteria or viruses. A current technology like Cepheid's GeneXpert technology is able to distinguish between the different RNA of various viruses, such as SARS-COV-2, or a particular influenza strain, but experts say it's become increasingly clear that our body's immune systems can be faster, more accurate detection systems. Historically, doctors have had to rely on a patient's case history and symptoms to narrow down the cause of an illness and develop a treatment plan. More recently, laboratory inspections at the molecular level such as the Cepheid technology have allowed clinicians to identify specific pathogens in nasal mucus, throat swabs or blood samples that might have caused an illness. But hunting for bacteria or a virus in this way can be time-consuming, costly and sometimes simply ineffective. The specific RNA signature of a virus can be hard to detect.Abbott and Cepheid did not respond to requests for comment.More from CNBC's Healthy ReturnsPfizer says mRNA technology can create seasonal flu shot of the futureAbbott's virus hunters and the search for new Covid variantsA psychedelic boom in PTSD and depression treatment is comingThe team at Imperial College, London, working separately but at the same time as several counterparts around the world, are now convinced that future diagnoses can soon be conducted using table-top tests that will take just a matter of minutes.These tests would not explicitly screen for a specific pathogen, but instead, allow scientists and medical professionals to simply watch how specific genes in the body are behaving as an indication of how an immune system is already responding to a pathogen that may not be easily otherwise detectable. Imperial College professor Mike Levin currently leads an ongoing European Union-funded study focused on this potential, called ""Diamonds."" In recent years he and other scientists have shown how the observed activity in a small number of our genes can work as a kind of shorthand for our body's immune response to a pathogen. If a handful of specific genes out of thousands in a blood sample are seen to be activated — or the opposite, inhibited — it can indicate that a person is preparing to fight off a specific pathogen.We think this is a completely revolutionary way of doing medical diagnosis.Imperial College professor Mike LevinLevin and colleagues already have a proof of concept for this diagnostic approach after studies involving thousands of patients with fever caused by tuberculosis, and hundreds of Kawasaki patients. And his Imperial College team's work with the ""Diamonds"" study are starting to bear fruit and could help identify the distinct immunological markers of illnesses like the coronavirus-linked multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children like Tayah Fernandes, now commonly known as MIS-C. When Covid-19 turned up in multiple locations, with MIS-C in its wake, it presented Levin and his researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to test this technique on an entirely new disease.In the future, these tests — by relying on huge amounts of data and machine learning — should be able to produce multi-class rather than just binary results. This means they could confirm not only if a pathogen is bacterial or viral, or whether someone has a specific disease or not, but could distinguish which one of a multitude of illnesses is afflicting their patient.In short, Levin expects that by examining the behavior of a relatively small number of genes, clinicians will be able to assign patients to all the major disease classes within an hour.""We think this is a completely revolutionary way of doing medical diagnosis,"" Levin said. He expects the research will provide the basis for new technology, but has no financial interest in any business related to it. Rather than what he calls the ""stepwise process"" of first eliminating bacterial infections, treating for the most common conditions, and then doing more investigation, ""this idea is the very first blood test can tell you, has the patient got an infection or not an infection, and what group of infection that is, right down to the individual pathogens.""Purvesh Khatri, an associate professor at the Stanford Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection and Department of Medicine, says our immune systems have been evolving for millennia to combat pathogens, and so it may prove more effective, and efficient, to examine the response of our bodies.""We didn't have a technology, until now, that could measure a set of genes in a rapid point of care way,"" he said. ""But in the last couple of years, there have been enough technologies available that now allow us to measure a few genes in a rapid multiplex point of care assay way.""While neither the FDA nor any European regulators have approved these kinds of gene-based pathogen detection systems, Khatri, who is helping launch a related commercial venture, says they're coming soon.

Small Business Playbook,The risky thinking that will define the post-Covid consumer: Wharton psychology guru,"Published Sat, Jun 5 20218:30 AM EDT",Eric Rosenbaum,"Key PointsConsumer psychology often comes down to the ways we perceive risk and the idea of loss aversion: we may lose more than we gain by making changes.The pandemic forced an abrupt shift in many buying and selling habits, but that does not mean all consumers will be permanently altered in a similar way.Political polarization over issues including mask policies add to an environment in which it is a mistake to think in terms of a monolithic ""post-Covid consumer.""Pedestrians wearing protective masks walk past a Lululemon store in San Francisco, California, on Monday, March 29, 2021.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInstead of jumping to a conclusion about the post-Covid consumer, revert to one that psychology studies educated us on long before the pandemic. Individuals don't change habits easily, and what they may stand to lose by changing behavior weighs more heavily on the mind than any potential gain.""Breaking habits is hard. It is an uphill battle,"" said Wharton professor of marketing and psychology Deborah Small at the recent CNBC Small Business Playbook Summit.The idea related to the way we perceive risk behind that is known in the academic field as loss aversion, and the pandemic did complicate it. An unprecedented event that suddenly forced consumers to go against their nature and into new behaviors, and out of many of the commerce interactions previously taken for granted: bars, cafes and restaurants, in-person fitness classes, and in-person education. Consumers have been exploring alternatives in ways they rarely do, and that occurred on top of a consumer landscape that is always changing, in recent years mostly related to digital buying and selling.""Lots of ways in which people consumed pre-pandemic won't return to those levels,"" Small said. ""We've been permanently changed by different experiences we had in the past year-plus.""But the Wharton professor also says it is unwise, based on all that we know about the consumer brain, to assume that the habits formed during the pandemic will become a permanent, preferred majority state. A recent Forrester survey found 75% of U.S. adults saying that the pandemic would drive long-term changes in behavior, but its research also stresses that the consumer has always been in a state of flux; it's just maybe now more likely that change is the ""new normal"" for consumers.In Small's view, there is no single consumer to sell to — and thinking in those terms would be a fundamental mistake.More from CNBC's Small Business PlaybookGary Vaynerchuk: The 3 social media 'requirements' for every small business'Shark' investor Robert Herjavec: 'I am highly, highly bullish'Life is Good was on brink of bankruptcy, here is what saved retailer: CEOHow to get billion-dollar retail to stock your million-dollar product ideaOffice reopening plans could make or break restaurants Take exercise, as an example, and the rise of workout-from-home Peloton before its momentum was taken away by what Wall Street calls the reopening trade. Meanwhile, Lululemon continues to sell a lot of yoga pants, but it has seen a steady increase in-store traffic after seeing the popularity of direct-to-consumer athleisure wear sales during the peak of Covid in the U.S. It also bought at-home fitness start-up and Peloton competitor Mirror.Betting on more than one kind of consumer — which was already occurring before the pandemic with the rise of digital — is a smarter strategy than planning around a fixed idea of the consumer emerging from the past year.""Imagine someone who used to go to the gym and then couldn't, started exercising from home. Maybe they really miss the old way and are dying to get back, and couldn't replicate it at home,"" Small said. The pandemic may ultimately reconfirm that person's original preference. On the other hand, she says, some consumers try new forms and conclude ""it is convenient for me"" and are changed forever.This thinking already has a name in retail, and big presence: omnichannel. Or in other words, spread your bets rather than concentrate them. Meet the consumer where they want to be met, and understand that each consumer is not motivated by the same set of preferences. Small said it is the type of thinking which small business owners across the country — if they were able to survive the pandemic or opportunistic enough to form a new business during it — need to be acting on as the post-pandemic period begins.She provided CNBC with a few key ideas for tackling this tricky consumer landscape.1. Learn the difference between risk and risk perception.Many people want to put the consumer into the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic buckets, and Small said that is actually a reasonable starting point in order to make predictions. Humans tend to categorize as a way of making sense of the world, it just becomes dangerous to categorize all consumers as being similar.""There is enormous heterogeneity, variation across consumers, in their views, risk preferences, political ideologies ... all the stuff shaping the way changes are affecting them,"" she told CNBC.That is why she says the first thing to keep in mind is the difference between risk and risk perception.""Risk perception is not risk,"" Small said. ""Risk is reality, it's truth. Risk perception is psychology, what we feel and think.""Risk perception is a function of personality and the culture we live in, and the information we consume. And that can all be varied at the individual and community level.2. Accept Covid-19 politics will continue to be a big buying and selling factor.The politics of the pandemic are an example of how risk perception needs to be factored into consumer marketing in the future.The information people consume in communities can be a function of local political ideology, and Small says it is compounded by the fact that social networks are overlapping, with individuals talking to others within a cluster.In communities and regions where there are greater concerns about Covid, consumers may remain more risk-averse even after the CDC guidance on mask-wearing eased. And there is going to be the polar opposite extreme — ""feelings of invulnerability and shades in between.""""Businesses need to measure and understand where their customers are coming from,"" the Wharton professor said.There may be areas where patrons, including fully vaccinated ones, continue to only enter stores where others are masked. That may be due to personal preference, new habits being formed or politics, including wanting to be an ally of essential workers who could still be at risk of contracting the virus. And there may be examples that go far in the opposite direction, and reinforce how political polarization is part of the future that Main Street businesses must navigate. Think of the hat store in Nashville, Tennessee, which made national headlines for yellow star lapels promoting non-vaccinated status.VIDEO18:0318:03Psych 101: New behaviors, new opportunities, Deborah Small at CNBC Small Business PlaybookSmall Business Playbook3. Don't draw a pandemic line, but maybe segment by preferences.Vaccination efforts in the U.S. have made great progress and case counts and mortality from the virus have sharply declined, but there is a significant portion of the public that will need more time to be at ease with Covid.Small says that means it is smart to maintain a stance that leans into hygiene, but also recognize that among your customer base there may be those who believe society went too far in reacting to the risk of the virus, and there is a risk of backlash towards businesses that overemphasize sanitation.""This is a tricky balancing act,"" Small said, one that is maybe most difficult to navigate for businesses in ""purple states.""She strongly recommends considering if there are ways to doing segmentation of consumers to meet the needs of those who continue to stress Covid hygiene and those who may feel differently. The idea of segmentation circles back to the heterogeneity that underlies human risk perception. As one example, it could be embraced by having business hours designated for different customer segments. Some businesses maintained shopping hours reserved only for older customers during the Covid peak.Small also said business owners should not lose focus on one forced change that has worked very well: conducting business outdoors. Some of the best innovations she has seen among small businesses where she lives related to figuring out more ways to do things outdoors. ""It's better for safety and lower risk ... so when possible that's great. Why didn't we think of it before?""4. Ask your customers what they want.The best way to learn what customers want? Ask them.For big companies, that can mean market research, a science that includes in-depth tools to measure concerns and preferences. And can be expensive.Small said it is not necessary for a small business to give up on the effort because it can't afford proper market research. There are plenty of good alternatives, from do-it-yourself Google Trends analysis to creating surveys using free online tools or Instagram for quick polling.""Asking customers questions is the key thing,"" she said.And it is important because another side of human nature that often trips us up is overconfidence.""We think we know customers well. Oftentimes our intuitions aren't correct,"" she said. ""So it is really useful to ask them. ... not just assume. Ask them those questions.""And she says people tend to tell the truth.""As a general rule ... if they are your customers and you have some relationship ... they want you to do well, so it is in their interest to be honest,"" Small said.Right now, they also probably have a lot of information to share that is valuable.""We've all had a lot of time to reflect in the last year and they have opinions. ... listen to customers,"" the Wharton professor said. ""Don't go with intuition. Talk to customers, seek feedback from them, and try to understand what they care about.""While assumptions are bad, and intuition can be wrong, Small also stressed that business owners should not be overwhelmed by the challenges, and should start by reflecting on what they've learned from so much having changed, the innovations they've come up with, and the extent to which they've been adaptive. ""Trust yourself,"" she said. ""If you have adapted before you can adapt again, and can you learn from the way you adapted before and apply it going forward.""Correction: Thinking we stand to lose more than we may gain is referred to as loss aversion in the field of psychology."
